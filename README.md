Spring Boot Docker Project

## Overview
This repository contains a dummy Spring Boot project containerized with Docker, 
created as part of my DevOps self-learning journey. 
The project features a simple REST API and serves as a trial before applying similar techniques to my `AirlineTicketBookingApp`.

## Key Highlights
- Built with Spring Boot and Java 17 using Maven.
- Containerized using Docker with a custom `Dockerfile`.
- Successfully tested at `http://localhost:9090/`, returning "Welcome to Docker!!!".
- Overcame challenges like 404 errors and port configuration.
